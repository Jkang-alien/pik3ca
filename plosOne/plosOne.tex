    PIK3CA mutation in selecting drug
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

Targeted thrapy becomes standard treatment in many cancer patients. To
treat with the targeted therapy, the The patients should be confirmed
the indicated genomic alterations in their cancer. Many direct test for
the genomic alteration has been developed and prooved for their clical
utility to discriminate which patients will be response the targeted
therapy.

The machine learning approach has been actively researched recently to
detect the genomic alterations. The machine learning can build a
prediction model from a large number of predictors such as radiolomic
features {[}1{]}, pathology image or gene expression data {[}2{]}. The
machine learning approach has limitations to apply to clinical practice.
However the machine learning prediction can be a second best when the
direct test fails.

PIK3CA is encodes the p110\(\alpha\) catalytic subunit of
phosphatidylinositol 3′-kinase (PI3K). PI3K is a protein kinase which
phosphorylates phosphatidylinositol 4,5-biphosphate
(PIP\textsubscript{2}) to make phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-triphosphate
(PIP\textsubscript{3}). Phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN) changes
PIP\textsubscript{2} to PIP\textsubscript{3} in contrast PI3K.
PIP\textsubscript{3} is a second mesenger to activate protein kinase B
(AKT) which is a serine/threonine-specific protein kinase. AKT inhibits
apoptosis and promote cell proliferation.

Breast cancer with PIK3CA mutation has been approved to use PIK3CA
inhibitor in hormone receptor positive HER2 negative subtype. {[}3{]}
The PIK3CA mutation is second most driver mutation after TP53. The
PIK3CA mutation is most frequantly founded in endometrial carcinoma
(45\%), and followed by breast invasive carcinoma (24\%), cervical
squamous cell carcinoma and endocervical adenocarcinoma (20\%) and colon
adenocarcinoma (16\%).

Prediction RAS pathway activation with gene expression data was done in
previous study. {[}4{]} They trained pancancer The Cancer Genome Atlas
(TCGA) data with a supervised elastic net penalized logistic regression
classifier with stochastic gradient descent. The performance of their
model was 84\% with an area under the receiver operating characteristic
(AUROC) curve and 63\% with an area under the precision recall (AUPR)
curve. We applied their modeling methods in prediction PIK3CA mutation.

\hypertarget{materials-and-methods}{%
\section{Materials and Methods}\label{materials-and-methods}}

\hypertarget{dataset}{%
\subsection{Dataset}\label{dataset}}

We used TCGA pancancer dataset. PIK3CA mutation data was get using cgdsr
rpackage.{[}5{]} Gene expression data was get from GDAC firehose using
RTCGAToolbox R package. {[}6{]}

10845 cases were available both PIK3CA mutation and mRNA expression
data. 5128 out of 20502 genes were included in the modeling process
after filtering with median absolute deviation as described at modelinf
process method. 33 cancer type dummy variables were included in
predictor variables.

The target variable was PIK3CA mutation status. The status of PIK3CA was
considered as positive when the case has following PIK3CA variants which
is the target variables of the therascreen PIK3CA RGQ PCR Kit; C420R,
E542K, E545A, E545D, E545G, E545K, Q546E, Q546R, H1047L, H1047R, H1047Y.
The therascreen PIK3CA RGQ PCR Kit was approved by U.S. Food and Drug
adminidtration for PIK3CA inhibitor. We splited the three quarters of
dataset for the trainset and one quarter for testset.

\hypertarget{modeling-process}{%
\subsection{Modeling process}\label{modeling-process}}

To narrow down potential predictors, Genes with a large the median
absolute deviation (more than third-quartiles) were selected.
Yeo-Johnson transformation was done to correct skewness. Centering and
scaling were done. All preprocessing was done using recipe r package.
{[}7{]} Penalized logistic regression was applied to prediction
modeling. 10-fold cross-validation with targe variable stratification
was done over the hyperparameter grid: \(\lambda\) \{\(10^{-5}\),
\(10^{-4}\),\(10^{-3}\),\(10^{-2}\),\(10^{-1}\), \(10^{0}\)\},
\(\alpha\) \{0.0, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75\}. Lambda is penalty scaling parameter
and alpha is mixing parameter of penalty function
(\((1-\alpha)/2 \lVert\beta\rVert_2^2+\alpha\lVert \beta \rVert_1\)).
{[}8{]} Model performance was evealuated with the area under receiver
operating characteristic (ROC) and area under the ROC (AUROC) and
precision recall (PR) and area under curve (AUPR). The modelin process
was done with tidymodels rpackage. {[}9{]}

\hypertarget{results}{%
\section{Results}\label{results}}

\hypertarget{dataset-summary}{%
\subsection{Dataset summary}\label{dataset-summary}}

Prevalcence of PIK3CA was 0.11 in all cases. The PIK3CA prevalance of
each cancer type was vary. The median prevalence of PIK3CA of each
cancer types was 0.03 (range 0-0.33) (Figure 1).

\hypertarget{selecting-model-and-performance-estimation}{%
\subsection{Selecting model and performance
estimation}\label{selecting-model-and-performance-estimation}}

In 10-fold cross-validation, the model with lambda = 0.01 and alpha =
1.0 (Ridge regression) were best performance in terms of AUROC. The
final model was trained with the selected hyperparameters with all
trainset.

The trainset AUROC was 0.93 and the testset AUROC was 0.84. The AUPR of
trainset was 0.66 and the testset AUPR was 0.39. (Figure 1A)

\hypertarget{performance-of-each-cancer-type}{%
\subsection{Performance of each cancer
type}\label{performance-of-each-cancer-type}}

Because tht prevalence of PIK3CA mutation is vary across the cancer
type, the performance of each cancer type was investigated. The AUROC
and AUPR were positively correlated between train set and test set in
cancer type subanalysis. (Figure 1B) The AUPR was high in cancer type
with high PIK3CA mutation rate such as colon, brest, Uterus cancer
types. The AUROC did not correlated with PIK3CA mutation rate of each
cancer types. (Figure 1C)

\hypertarget{important-predictors}{%
\subsection{Important predictors}\label{important-predictors}}

Figure 2 shows top 30 important predictors. The coefficient is the
parameter of the predictor which represent the effect of the predictor
on prediction. IGF1R mRNA expression was the strongest negative
predictor and PTEN was the strongest positive predictor. Both genes and
PIK3CA are key players in tyrosin kanase pathway. The cancer type was
important predictors. Some cancer types including uterine carcinosarcoma
(UCS), bladder urothelial carcinoma (BLCA), pancreatic adenocarcinoma
(PAAD), lymphoid neoplasm diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBC) are
strongest predictors.

\hypertarget{discussion}{%
\section{Discussion}\label{discussion}}

Our model showed good performance to predict PIK3CA mutation of various
cancer types.

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Main message answers the question and main supporting evidence
\item
  Critical assessment opinions on any shortcomings in study design
\end{itemize}

In this study, the split method was done for testset instead of
indepedent testset. Because there is no standard analysis method for the
RNA-seq gene expression quantification, it is difficult to find gene
expression data same as TGCA data. Developing standard analysis method
for gene expression data is neccessory to apply this prediction model.

In this study, the prevalence of PIK3CA mutation was 11\%. The low
prevalence of PIK3CA results in imbalaced dataset which makes the
prediction difficult. The AUROC is optimistic in terms of performance.
The AUPR is more informative than AUROC on imbalaced datasets. {[}10{]}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  limitations in methods

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Case imbalance\\
  \item
    flaws in analysis\\
  \item
    validity of assumption
  \end{itemize}
\item
  Comparison with other studies where inconsistencies are discussed\\
\item
  Evaluate the results - not the authors
\end{itemize}

Our PIK3CA prediction model performed better than RAS activation
prediction model of previous study in terms of both AUROC (0.84 vs 0.75)
and AUPR (0.39 vs 0.24) on testset prediction. Our testset is
corresponding to the samples initially filtered from training. The
target variable of our study is more specific than the previous study.
The specific important mutations can effect stronger downsteam gene
expression than the broad events pathway activation. The previous study
might be more difficult prediction problum.

Our model includes cancer type predictor and they are stronger than gene
expression data. The varing prevalence of PIC3CA mutation across cancer
type might reason of the strong cancer type predictor. If the cancer
type was wrong or can not be determined, our model performance can be
poor.

  and suggestions for further research.
